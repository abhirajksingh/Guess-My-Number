# Guess-My-Number
The "Guess My Number" game is a simple guessing game where one player thinks of a number within a specified range, 
and the other player (or players) try to guess that number within a certain number of attempts. 
Here are the basic rules for the game:

<h3>Gameplay : </h3>
The player, often referred to as the "guessers," take turns guessing the secret number.

After each guess, the chooser provides feedback to the guesser to indicate whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The guessers continue making guesses until they either correctly guess the secret number or reach a predetermined limit on the number of guesses.

<h3>Rules : </h3>
<h4>Range : </h4> You can adjust the range of numbers to make the game easier or more difficult. 
                For example, you could choose a range of 1 to 20.
<h4>Hints : </h4> It simply say "To High" or "To Low," to indicate proximity to the secret number.
<h4>Multiple Guessers : </h4> You can have multiple guessers take turns guessing the secret number, with each guesser getting feedback.
<h4>Winning Conditions : </h4> Decide if the guessers win when they correctly guess the number or 
if they lose if they reach the maximum (20) allowed guesses without guessing correctly.

<h5>Here's an example of how a round of the "Guess My Number" game might play out:</h5>

The chooser selects a secret number between 1 and 20.
The guesser says, "Is it 15?"
The chooser responds, "Lower."
The guesser says, "Is it 19?"
The chooser responds, "Higher."
Guesses continue until a guesser correctly identifies the secret number or the maximum number of allowed guesses is reached.
The game can be a fun way to practice deductive reasoning and is often played casually for entertainment.
